- 👋 Hi, I’m @Iamcertainlyhappytoday
- 👀 I’m interested in ... help really. I don't understand how to open things and run them despite having practiced a lot. The problem for me seems to be the
-  interface moments, connecting it all together for the universal server.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... jscript despite being told it is past it now, tried Python but it seemed to be jscript with less words, like riding behind it 
- and I can do quite a lot with HTML and CSS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Well, my website is trailtour.online and I would collaborate with ideas, am trying to get to the next stage for an audience
- to want to read the site.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
